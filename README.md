## ‚≠êÔ∏è Getting Started

This README is my roadmap to conquering coding challenges on LeetCode. It will guide my learning journey, provide valuable resources, and keep me motivated to consistently sharpen my programming skills.

### üëäüèª Let's Gear Up!

***Define My Goals:*** I need to be clear about what I want to achieve with LeetCode. Is it for interview preparation, general skill development, or simply the thrill of problem-solving? Having defined goals will fuel my focus and keep me driven.

***Choose My Path:*** LeetCode offers a variety of learning paths categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and topic (Arrays, Linked Lists, Strings, etc.). I can also create custom paths tailored to my interests.

***Embrace Consistency:*** I should aim for regular practice, even if it's just for short bursts each day. Consistent effort is the key to substantial improvement.
My LeetCode Diary

This section serves as a daily log to track my progress. Use the following format to record my practice sessions:

> - swap-nodes-in-pairs
> - minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers
> - sqrt(x)
> - sum-of-all-subset-XOR-totals
> - wildcard-matching

#### üìù Learning Notes

* Use this section to jot down any key takeaways, algorithms I encounter, or tips I learn along the way.
* This will be a valuable reference for future problems or interview preparation.

##### ü§ñ Beyond the Basics

* LeetCode Discuss Forums: Connect with the LeetCode community to ask questions, share solutions, and learn from others' experiences.
* LeetCode Articles: Explore articles on various coding concepts and problem-solving strategies.
* Online Tutorials and Books: Supplement my learning with external resources that fit my learning style.

#### üß† Remember:

* Consistency is king. Regular practice builds mastery.
* Push my boundaries. Step outside my comfort zone and tackle more challenging problems as I become more confident.
* Embrace the journey. It's okay to get stuck sometimes. Take a break, come back with fresh eyes, or seek help from the LeetCode community.
